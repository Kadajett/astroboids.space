---

### **3. Architectural Overview**

#### **Microservices Architecture**

- **Authentication Service:** Handles user registration, login, and session management using Clerk.
- **Game State Service:** Manages the game world, including sectors, ships, and movements.
- **Script Execution Service:** Executes user-uploaded scripts in a secure sandbox.
- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to appropriate services and handles cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting.

#### **Scalability Focus**

- **Stateless Services:** Design services to be stateless where possible to facilitate horizontal scaling.
- **Event-Driven Communication:** Use message queues (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) for decoupled, asynchronous communication between services.

---

### **4. Authentication with Clerk**

#### **Integration Steps**

1. **Set Up Clerk:**
   - Create a Clerk account and set up your application in the Clerk dashboard.
   - Obtain API keys and configuration details.

2. **Install Clerk SDKs:**
   - Frontend: `bun install @clerk/clerk-react`
   - Backend: `bun install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node`

3. **Configure Clerk in Next.js:**
   - Wrap your Next.js App with `ClerkProvider`.
   - Use `withServerSideAuth` for server-side authentication.

   ```jsx
   // _app.tsx
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

   function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
     return (
       <ClerkProvider frontendApi="your-frontend-api">
         <Component {...pageProps} />
       </ClerkProvider>
     );
   }

   export default MyApp;
   ```

4. **Protect API Routes:**
   - Use Clerk middleware to secure API endpoints.

   ```typescript
   // pages/api/secure-endpoint.ts
   import { withAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/api';

   export default withAuth((req, res) => {
     const { userId } = req.auth;
     // Your secure logic here
   });
   ```

#### **Scalability Considerations**

- **Token-Based Authentication:**
  - Use JWTs to authenticate API requests, enabling stateless authentication.

- **Session Storage:**
  - Let Clerk handle session storage to reduce server load.

- **Edge Authentication:**
  - Utilize Clerk's edge middleware for faster authentication at CDN edges.

- **Caching User Data:**
  - Cache authentication tokens and user metadata to minimize repeated validation.

---

### **5. Data Management with Supabase**

#### **Schema Design**

- **Users Table:**
  - `id`: UUID (primary key)
  - `username`: String (unique)
  - `email`: String (unique)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp

- **Scripts Table:**
  - `id`: UUID (primary key)
  - `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to Users)
  - `script_name`: String
  - `script_code`: Text
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

- **Ships Table:**
  - `id`: UUID (primary key)
  - `user_id`: UUID (foreign key to Users)
  - `sector_id`: UUID (current location)
  - `status`: JSONB (health, cargo, etc.)

- **Sectors Table:**
  - `id`: UUID (primary key)
  - `coordinates`: Point or JSON (for spatial queries)
  - `properties`: JSONB (resources, hazards, etc.)

#### **Real-time Features**

- **Subscriptions:**
  - Clients subscribe to changes in relevant tables (e.g., Ships, Sectors).
  - Use Supabase's real-time capabilities to push updates.

#### **Scalability Strategies**

- **Connection Pooling:**
  - Use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to manage database connections.

- **Read Replicas:**
  - Deploy read replicas to handle read-heavy workloads.

- **Indexing:**
  - Create indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `sector_id`, `user_id`).

- **Partitioning:**
  - Partition large tables by time or region to improve query performance.

---

### **6. Script Upload and Execution Environment**

#### **Script Upload Mechanism**

- **Local Editing Synchronization:**
  - Provide a CLI tool or desktop app to sync local scripts with the server.
  - Use WebSockets or REST API for script uploads.

- **Web Editor:**
  - Integrate Monaco Editor in the web interface for in-browser editing.
  - Implement auto-save and version control features.

#### **Secure Sandboxing**

- **Execution Environment:**
  - Use **Isolated-vm** or **Node VM2** to run scripts in a secure context.
  - Alternatively, use **WebAssembly (WASM)** for better performance and security.

- **Resource Limits:**
  - Set timeouts and memory limits per script execution (e.g., 100ms CPU time, 50MB memory).

- **API Exposure:**
  - Expose a limited set of APIs to the scripts (e.g., movement commands, sensor data).
  - Use a proxy or API surface to prevent unauthorized actions.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Allow scripts to import from a whitelisted set of modules.
  - Prevent use of `require` or dynamic imports to restrict access.

#### **Scaling Script Execution**

- **Worker Pool:**
  - Implement a pool of worker processes or threads dedicated to script execution.
  - Use a job queue (e.g., **BullMQ** with Redis) to manage execution tasks.

- **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - Scale out the Script Execution Service across multiple instances or containers.
  - Use a load balancer to distribute execution requests.

- **Event-Driven Execution:**
  - Trigger script executions based on game ticks or events to optimize resource usage.

- **Caching Compiled Scripts:**
  - Cache bytecode or compiled versions of scripts to reduce overhead.

---

### **7. Shared Global Timer and Game Loop**

#### **Implementation Strategies**

- **Centralized Timer Service:**
  - Create a dedicated service to manage the global game loop.
  - Emit tick events at regular intervals (e.g., every second).

- **Distributed Timer (for High Availability):**
  - Use leader election (e.g., via **etcd** or **Zookeeper**) to ensure only one active timer.
  - In case of failure, another instance takes over.

#### **Synchronization Across Servers**

- **Event Broadcasting:**
  - Use Redis Pub/Sub or a message broker like **NATS** to broadcast tick events.
  - All game servers subscribe to tick events to maintain synchronization.

- **Time Drift Handling:**
  - Use NTP or a time synchronization service to keep server clocks in sync.
  - Implement logic to handle minor discrepancies in tick timings.

---

### **8. Infinite Map of Sectors**

#### **Map Generation and Storage**

- **Procedural Generation:**
  - Use a deterministic algorithm with a seed to generate sectors on the fly.
  - Only store deviations from the base generation (e.g., player-built structures).

- **Spatial Indexing:**
  - Use spatial data types in PostgreSQL (PostGIS) for efficient queries.

#### **Efficient Data Access**

- **Lazy Loading:**
  - Load sector data into memory only when needed (e.g., when a player enters).

- **Caching:**
  - Cache frequently accessed sectors in memory or a fast key-value store like Redis.

- **Data Partitioning:**
  - Partition sectors by coordinate ranges to distribute load.

---

### **9. API Design and Scalability**

#### **RESTful API Endpoints**

- **Versioning:**
  - Prefix endpoints with `/api/v1` to allow for future changes.

- **Authentication:**
  - Secure endpoints using Clerk tokens.
  - Example endpoints:
    - `POST /api/v1/scripts/upload`
    - `GET /api/v1/ships/status`
    - `POST /api/v1/ships/move`

#### **Rate Limiting and Throttling**

- **Per-IP and Per-User Limits:**
  - Implement rate limiting using middleware (e.g., **express-rate-limit**).

- **API Gateway:**
  - Use an API gateway like **Kong** or **AWS API Gateway** to manage traffic.

- **Throttling Strategies:**
  - Queue requests when limits are exceeded instead of outright rejection.

---

### **10. Frontend Development with Next.js 14**

#### **App Router Structure**

- **Directory Structure:**

  ```
  /app
    /api
      /v1
        [endpoints].ts
    /dashboard
      page.tsx
    /editor
      page.tsx
    /map
      page.tsx
    /[...catchAll]
  ```

- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - Use dynamic segments for user-specific pages.

#### **Performance Optimization**

- **Code Splitting:**
  - Utilize dynamic imports for heavy components (e.g., code editor, map renderer).

- **Static Assets CDN:**
  - Serve static assets via a CDN to reduce load times.

- **Client-Side Caching:**
  - Implement caching strategies using service workers or `IndexedDB`.

---

### **11. Testing and Monitoring**

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Script uploads, script execution, real-time updates, authentication flows.

#### **Real-time Monitoring**

- **Metrics Collection:**
  - Instrument your application with Prometheus metrics.

- **Visualization:**
  - Use Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU, memory, response times, error rates.

- **Alerting:**
  - Set up alerts for critical thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage, failed script executions).

---

### **12. Deployment and Infrastructure**

#### **Containerization**

- **Docker Images:**
  - Create Dockerfiles for each service.
  - Use multi-stage builds to optimize image sizes.
